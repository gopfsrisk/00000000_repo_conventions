# 20200401_repo_conventions

Welcome to the GitHub profile for the Risk team at PRestige Financial Services.

This profile has been created as a place for us to store the code we write safely and with version control.

To help keep our work organized, we will create a repository for each project on which we work with the following naming convention:

```YYYYMMDD_project_name```
