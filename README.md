## Welcome

Welcome to the GitHub for the Risk team at Prestige Financial Services.

This organization has been created as a place for us to store the code we write, collaborate on projects, all with version control.

---

### Rules:

1. Name repositories using the following convention:
* ```YYYYMMDD_project_name```

2. **Do not use spaces** in the names of repositories.

3. Each repository needs to be set to **private** 

4. **No data** will be stored on Github. Data should be stored on the shared drive.
* *Note*: if the repository is an installable package (i.e., [prestige](https://github.com/gopfsrisk/prestige), for example) it does not need to use the naming convention and can be public.

5. Include a *brief* description of each project inside the ```README.md``` will be helpful to remind us of the purpose of each project.
