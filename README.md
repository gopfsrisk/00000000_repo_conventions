## Welcome

Welcome to the GitHub profile for the Risk team at Prestige Financial Services.

This profile has been created as a place for us to store the code we write safely and with version control.

---

## Rules:

1. Name repositories using the following convention:
* ```YYYYMMDD_project_name```

2. **Do not use spaces** in the names of repositories.

3. Each repository needs to be set to **private** 

4. **No data** will be stored on Github. Data should be stored on the shared drive.
* *Note*: if the repository is an installable package (i.e., [prestige](https://github.com/gopfsrisk/prestige), for example) it does not need to use the naming convention and can be public.

5. Include a *brief* description of each project inside the ```README.md``` will be helpful to remind us of the purpose of each project.

## Working with private repositories:

To clone, change, and push a **private** repository via SSH (from the terminal):

1. Clone a repository:
* ```git clone https://gopfsrisk:<insert_password_here>@github.com/gopfsrisk/<insert_repository_name_here>.git ``` (*Note*: do not include the "<" and ">" symbols)

2. Make changes locally.

3. Push the repository back to GitHub:
* ```git init```
* ```git add .```
* ```git commit -m "Insert short note here."```
* ```git remote add origin https://github.com/gopfsrisk/<insert_repo_name_here>.git```
* ```git push origin master```

## Working with public repositories:

To clone, change, and push a **public** repository via SSH (from the terminal):

1. Clone a repository:
* ```git clone https://github.com/gopfsrisk/<insert_repo_name_here>.git``` (*Note*: do not include the "<" and ">" symbols)
